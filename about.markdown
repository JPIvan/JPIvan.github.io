### Who am I?

I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at Ã–rebro University with quasistable interests in philisophy, StarCraft, linguistics, pedagogy, fantasy novels, and options trading.

My research is broadly in machine learning, and more specifically concerned with a type of model called a Gaussian process.
Gaussian processes can be used for regression and classification, and are often described as providing a principled approach to probabilistic machine learning.

Here 'principled' mostly means that we are interested in the assumptions we make, that we derive results in a rigorous manner, and that we care about *exactly* how our methods work.
Gaussian processes are therefore interpretable, understandable, and transparent.

### How did we get here?

After my bachelors in mechanical engineering I was really interested in control and fluid dynamics and thought that solving novel problems in these areas would be a really interesting direction to move in.
However, I feared that I didn't really have a strong enough mathematical background to study the sorts of problems I was interested in.
Thus, I began a masters in applied mathematics - which I enjoyed so much that I revised my plan to 'any work that will let me carry on doing a lot of math'.

And here we are.
