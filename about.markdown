### Who am I?

My background and interests are rather mixed, and so coming up with a simple answer to this question had me stumped for quite some time. A good place to start might then be my qualifications and immediate goals.

I hold a B.Eng. in mechanical engineering from the University of Pretoria, and an M.Sc. in engineering mathematics from Mälardalens Högskola. I'm currently applying for Ph.D. positions in engineering, mathematics, computer science, or didactics. The fact that I have been programming in a variety of languages since high-school has contributed greatly to my academic development and choices in my studies thusfar. My focus has always been on scientific computing, numerical methods, or computer mathematics in some form or another; with a good deal of my high-school programming featuring solving problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) in C++. Some of my attempts featured, unnecessary but fun, optimisations in SSE/SIMD and CUDA.

Well, that seems like a relatively straightforward history. Barring the interest in didactics it wouldn't seem unreasonable to use any number of STEM-related buzzwords to summarise myself. That said, I don't want to label this as an engineer's website or a mathematical blog. I have a deep interest in linguistics, language learning, theory of cognition, pedagogy, fantasy writing, options trading, Starcraft 2, gardening, woodwork, and countless more. Some of these might fit the bill well for a typical STEM-related personal website... but others less so.

### What is this website all about?

To be honest, I do not have extremely concrete goals at the moment. I want to use this website as a platform for academic notes on various topics that I find interesting, but have had ideas about using it for any and all of my above-mentioned interests.

As you may have seen, however, the first project I've decided to 'formally' launch is a series of notes and discussions on convex optimisation.
