# Overview

During my masters I took a course on convex optimisation which used the book Convex Optimisation by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe as a reference text. Aside from really enjoying the course I thought the book itself was worderful (I can't stress how well it is written), but noticed many of my fellow students struggled with using and applying the material covered in the book.

The goal of this project is to supplement anyone working through the book with some select examples and discussions. The source for all the notebooks used in these discussions is [available](https://github.com/JPIvan/optimisation) and contributions are welcome.

Likewise, this entire website is [open-source](https://github.com/JPIvan/JPIvan.github.io). As such, any errors in my writing are also open for correction.

Once again, these notes are intended as an aid to anyone working through Boyd's book. I doubt they will be even fractionally as instructive as a standalone reference. I hope you will find these resources useful.

The links below will take you to a jupyter notebook made for each section, beneath this you will find some extra discussion of the contents of the notebooks.
