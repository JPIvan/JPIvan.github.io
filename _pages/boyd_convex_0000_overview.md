# Overview

During my masters I took a course on convex optimisation which used the book Convex Optimisation by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe as a reference text. Aside from really enjoying the course I thought the book itself was worderful (I can't stress how well it is written), but noticed many of my fellow students struggled with using and applying the material covered in the book.

The goal of this project is to supplement anyone working through the book with some select examples and discussions. The source for all the notebooks used in these discussions is [available](https://github.com/JPIvan/optimisation) and contributions are welcome. The functions I show will not be perfect, and may contain inefficiencies that would be unacceptable in an optimisation library like `scipy.optimize`, but the point of this is not to show a beginner how to write tight, ruthlessly efficient code that can compete with years of open-source effort or corporate development. What I hope to achieve is to show how to think about translating mathematics and algorithms described in a text like Boyd's into a functional program.

This entire website is [open-source](https://github.com/JPIvan/JPIvan.github.io). As such, any errors in my writing are also open for correction. (I know exactly 0 about frontend development, so I apologise in advance to anyone that knows what they're doing for subjecting them to my hacked-together repo.)

Once again, these notes are intended as an aid to anyone working through Boyd's book. I doubt they will be even fractionally as instructive as a standalone reference, so please refer to the book first and these notes second. That said, I hope you will find these resources useful.

See the sidebar for links to notebooks and discussions on various topics.
