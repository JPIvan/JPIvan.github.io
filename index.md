I have a repository based on the book Convex Optimisation by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vanderberghe. I hope to extend this material in future.

1. [Overview](/boyd-convex-optimisation)
2. [Chapter 1 - Introduction](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JPIvan/optimisation/blob/main/notebooks/boyd_ch1.ipynb)
