# Notes on Convex Optimisation

I have a repository based on the book Convex Optimisation by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vanderberghe, and some collected notes on the subject. These materials are mostly intended to support students working through the material. You can find what is currently available [here](/boyd-convex-optimisation).
